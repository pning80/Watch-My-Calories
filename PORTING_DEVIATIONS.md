# Porting Deviation Registry

Every documented divergence between the iOS app and the Android port. Per `PORTING_CRITERIA.md` Operating Principle 1, an Android divergence is either:
1. **Listed here** with iOS behavior, Android behavior, rationale, and sign-off — meaning it is an intentional, accepted departure, **OR**
2. **Not listed** — meaning it is a defect, treated as such at review.

No undocumented divergences are permitted to ship.

## Sign-off process

A row is "signed off" once the reviewer initials the **Sign-off** column with a date. Before sign-off, the row is a *proposal* — it does not grant ship permission. Reviewers who sign off accept responsibility that the rationale holds; revisiting requires a new row (do not edit a signed-off row's rationale).

## Active deviations

| ID | Surface / Criterion | iOS behavior | Android behavior | Rationale | Proposed by | Sign-off |
|----|---------------------|--------------|------------------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| D-001 | T1.2 `UserProfile` shape | SwiftData `@Model` class with no explicit `id` property; singleton invariant enforced by application logic (only one instance is ever inserted). | Room `@Entity` requires a `@PrimaryKey`; uses `val id: Int = 1` and the application always reads/writes that single row. | Room does not permit `@Entity` types without a primary key. The Android `id` is an internal storage detail; semantically identical singleton on both platforms. | agent | _pending review_ |

---

## Resolved (no longer divergent)

When a deviation is closed (Android brought into parity with iOS, or vice versa), move the row here with the resolution date and the commit SHA that closed it.

| ID | Surface | Resolution | Closed by SHA | Date |
|----|---------|------------|---------------|------|
| (none yet) | | | | |

---

## Template

```
| D-NNN | T1.x (criterion) | <what iOS does> | <what Android does> | <why this is acceptable; cost of parity vs. value> | <author> | <reviewer initials YYYY-MM-DD> |
```

Use a monotonically increasing `D-NNN` ID. Once issued, an ID is not reused even if the row moves to Resolved.
